          <p>We take a “mobile first” approach to projects. Mobile technology moves quickly and the number of different devices is growing. Users’ expectation of flawless, continuous service has never been higher.</p>

  <p>To deal with this, we have been developing a mobile testing framework that allows us to test our work across a number of different devices automatically. A fresh version of the site is published, and then each of the target devices runs through a series of end-to-end browser tests using virtual users.</p>
  <p>This testing framework allows us to quickly identify issues and manage an ever-growing list of supported devices.</p>
