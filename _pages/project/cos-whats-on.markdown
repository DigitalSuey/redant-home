#### Project Description


		Whatâ€™s On is no ordinary events website. To maximise engagement with the many different communities within the City of Sydney, we built a customised event listing function, allowing organisers to submit their events directly to the website. Visitors can browse events listings via a range of search tools, to find local events, free events and more.

		Convenient calendar interface for browsing events
		Community focus, with submit events function and social media sharing
		Meets Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 standards
		Search for specific events by location, time, keywords or category
		Fully integrated with Google maps
