  <p>Here are some of the key things our strategy team will look at when approaching a new project:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Detailed knowledge of your company and how the different areas and departments work.</li>
    <li>In depth understanding of your target markets and how they wish to engage online – resulting in knowing what will work and what won’t work online.</li>
    <li>Recommendations on suppliers – we’ve worked extensively with suppliers and other partner agencies for SEO, sample fulfilment, hosting and more.</li>
    <li>Mobile First approach.</li>
    <li>Constant tracking that allows us to improve and adjust strategies moving forward.</li>
  </ul>
