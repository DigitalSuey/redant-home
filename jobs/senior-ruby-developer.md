summary: Looking for a great place to work on interesting projects?

### Us

We’re a Ruby development agency. We’ve been around for over 24 years. Obviously not doing Ruby all that time, but let’s not talk about the dark days. But we’ve been around, developers seem to really love working here. Stable, we're not a startup, we avoid jerks, nice people.

Rather than work on a single app, our developers work across a number of challenging projects. We have some start-ups, but most of our projects are for well-established clients with meaty problems to solve.

### You

You’re an experienced developer. You know your stuff. Making nice stuff is what you do. Pride in the craft of engineering awesome things. You give thoughtful code reviews.

Sure, you could probably become the next CTO of some crazy start-up, or get a job at Google/Salesforce/IBM/etc. and impress your Mum. But we think you’ll like it here.

How about if I explain us a bit more:

1. **We’re not consultants.** We don’t take on projects for a few months and then hand over (all the while knowing that this elegant yet fragile code is pretty much impossible to maintain). We like where the tyre hits the road, because we think that is where stuff gets really interesting. We value long term projects, because we know that by refining and iterating we can continually improve an idea.
2. **We all work together.** To work together as a high performing team, we think meaningful conversations and interactions are important. To make great digital things, so many different parts need to come together perfectly - from UX to DevOps.
3. **We’re not an ad agency & we don’t outsource.** We build. We’re pretty geeky, and while we have content, UX & design people, we’re undeniably technical. And to be technically good you need not only good people but excellent processes and a strong tech culture. People that care. We’re not that company that seems to build things but actually gets all the work done by the offshore team in Nepal or Poland or wherever. I’m sure they’re great, but I think there are better things you could be doing with your career other than baby sitting an offshore team. Personally I’d rather clean my ears with a Dremel.
4. **We work with nice people** as our clients. Life is too short to work with dickheads, and it goes both ways. 

### Full time

This is a full time position - just in case you're planning out your side hustle. This isn't it. And no, watching that Youtube about the 4h work week and how you're actually going to get some guys in Vietnam to do all your dev work is not something you should bring up in the interview.

### Is this remote or on site?

Well, with the dreaded Rona, everything has changed. We used to all work together in a really nice, light filled office that was located in the very epicentre of HipsterLand. But since early March, we've all been working from home. So we'll kit out your home office just right, and we'll Slack and Zoom away. You can work from wherever you'd like.

### So you all work from home, but pretty soon you'll all be back in the office, right?

Nup. We're pretty tight operationally. We track what people are working on, how well they're progressing, and how happy they are with their work. Since we changed to work from home, our productivity is way up, sick leave is way down, and we're pretty busy. So we're good.

### How much it pays

Really well. Probably much better than where you are right now. But nowhere near as much as that recruiter swears you're actually worth. She would know, right- with all that deep deep Rails on Ruby experience, amazing contacts from LinkedIn etc - she would never just make that up.

### Interested?

If you’re interested in this position, pro tip: please don’t send in a huge Word doc CV. Just shoot an email to [Sarah](mailto:jobs@redant.com.au) with an outline of the kind of projects you’ve worked on, and some insight into who you are. We would love to hear from you.
