In a nutshell, Lean Development is about eliminating waste, maximising learnings, empowering the team and building integrity into projects. Lean development and the agile methodology go hand in hand in a lot of ways. For example, lean development acknowledges that uncertainty is a natural part of development, and the agile framework allows for constant adjustments as events unfold and circumstances change. Perfect. 
	
Ruby on Rails is also a great fit for lean development. Having a whole team working “the Rails way” and adhering to curated technology decisions means we save a lot of time and effort that used to get spent arguing over the best way to approach a task.
