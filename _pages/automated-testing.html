  <p>We use automated testing processes to check and re-check our client sites. These are automatic scripts that describe to a virtual user how the site should look and behave - eg “when you click on this you should see that”. These virtual users comprehensively run through thousands of different parts of the site to check that everything is working correctly.</p>
  <p>When testing a web project, we check for four key things:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Does it work correctly?</li>
    <li>Does it look right?</li>
    <li>Is everything else still working?</li>
    <li>Are there any security holes?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Each time a developer makes a change, it is sent to the lead developer for peer review. Once approved it is added to the GitHub code repository, which triggers a series of automated tests to check against all of the above criteria. By carefully describing how the site should function and then testing those functions, any issues are immediately picked up and resolved.</p>
