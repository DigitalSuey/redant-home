  <h3>Project Description</h3>

<a href="http://www.rethinkrefugees.com.au" target="_blank"><strong>Rethink Refugees</strong></a> is a campaign by Amnesty International to raise awareness and provide information and real stories about refugees in Australia.

Facts, Real Stories, News and Support are some of the ways to introduce the people behind the headlines.

This site has been created to communicate what's like to being forced to leave what’s familiar – home and loved ones.

People go through very difficult stories when their only hope of protection and safety is to get on a boat and risk their life. The purpose is to raise awareness about what asylum seekers have been through

Provide accurate information and reject the myths and misconceptions that have dominated the asylum seeker and refugee debate in Australia.
