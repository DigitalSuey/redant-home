React is a JavaScript framework maintained by Facebook that's ideal for building complex, modern user interfaces. React solves many of the problems that developers face when trying to build and maintain large, complex web applications. It’s an open source technology that is supported both by Facebook and a large open source community.
ReactJS allows a developer to create one set of code, and then deploy one version to the web, and ReactNative versions of the same code to Apple iOS and Android. This saves time and money initially, and also reduces the burden of having to maintain three separate code bases.
