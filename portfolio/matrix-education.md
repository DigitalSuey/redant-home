### Project background

Matrix Education provides High School Tutoring across 5 Sydney locations. They came to us for a Rails developer after working on a new website for some time. The new website aimed to help them manage the complexity of running multiple classes, multiple tutors and multiple locations. Allowing both the students and the Matrix Admin team to change classes with ease. The previous website was slow and inflexible making it difficult to make timetable changes as the business needed.

#### The problem - Digital Project Planning

In an all too common scenario the business owners believed that the bulk of the development had been done but there was just the last 20% of work to be done to complete and launch the new site. The problem was no one knew exactly what that last 20% was.

#### What we did - Digital Roadmapping

The key to success here was working deeply with the client to be really clear on the Users, their goals and the goals of the business. We embarked on a journey of discovery together - to find out what they really needed and then relate that to what they currently had.

Running a series of workshops with Matrix we were all able to understand what needed to be done and why and created the [Roadmap](/our-approach/) for development. We then prioritise the workload into a series of actionable Agile Sprints that delivered what was really needed to complete the new website.

With a series of actionable Sprints defined the actual execution was straight forward build with Ruby on Rails in the backend and React on the front end.

#### Key Points

- A [Code Review](/ruby-on-rails-code-review/) prior to launch gives you the clarity to make sure what you wanted is what you are getting.
- Product owners are often surprised by the level of detail required in a digital project discovery phase but ultimately a [detailed approach](/our-approach/) provides the best outcome and spend of budget.
- Taking the time to define the User Stories carefully makes it so much easier to understand what needs to be done and the priorities for development.
- Using an Agile methodology to define Sprints of work puts the business owner back in control of a complex digital build.
