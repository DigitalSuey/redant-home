#### Project Description


		Selleys is more than just a brand website for maintenance and cleaning products. It’s a DIY-lovers one stop shop for all things home care and renovation. With thousands of pages of content on everything from how to repair holes in a plaster wall, to car care and pest control, Selleys has evolved into an extensive website with interactive tools, member exclusive content and more.

		Some of our biggest Selleys projects so far:

		Ask an Expert tool – not sure how to stop leaks in a caravan awning? Just ask the Selleys Expert or browse existing Expert Answers.
		Handyman House – an interactive tool where users can explore the “Selleys Handyman House” and watch videos on home renovation, general maintenance and repairs.
		Selleys DIY Club – join the Selleys community to receive regular newsletter updates, competitions and promotions, plus access to exclusive areas of the website.
