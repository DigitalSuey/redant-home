  <h3>Project Description</h3>

My Nikon Life brings the Nikon brand to life by inspiring enthusiasts to challenge themselves and participate in a variety of photographic assignments. This site is a rich source of information, tips and techniques to build photographic expertise and even offers a ‘Nikon School’ to help new entrants develop their techniques. The site invites members to take a look at the latest gear and write reviews. We developed this site in partnership with the Apparent Agency.
