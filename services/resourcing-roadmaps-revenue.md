title: The 3Rs - resourcing, roadmaps, revenue
subtitle_1: These 3Rs are some of the most important aspects of your platform development. They are linked, and they will determine if your product is a success.
subtitle_2: Building a digital product can be daunting. Agile methodology was developed to help tech teams plan their work into short term “sprints” usually around 30 days. This gives flexibility to adapt and make changes along the way. However if you’ve got a fixed budget or fixed timeline - then you’re going to need a bit more certainty.

#### 3Rs Workshop, Roadmap and Sprint Plan

We start with a 1 day workshop to really understand your users, goals and existing tech stack if you have one.

Then using Agile methodologies we can create a roadmap and sprint plan to achieve your development goals. Giving you clarity in terms of resourcing and timing.

The focus will be on delivering early. Getting your digital product or service in front of your users quickly and generating value early. Identifying different revenue or value pathways is essential to the long term success of any digital project.

At the end you will gain clarity over your development path, resourcing and project value. You will have an actionable report to share with investors, stakeholders and your development team.

Our planning processes have helped startups and established corporates get in front of their users quickly. If you have a digital project that needs a jump start contact us today to discuss a 3Rs Workshop, Roadmap and Sprint Plan.
