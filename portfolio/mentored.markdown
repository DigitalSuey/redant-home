#### Project Description

<<<<<<< HEAD
Mentored is the digital side of Mark Bouris’s Channel 7 TV series The Mentor. A Mentor is a trusted advisor, someone you can turn to for advice and guidance, especially in business. Mentored.com.au is scaling that notion for the Australian small business community. 

Think of it like LinkedIn but focussed on Aussie small business. Mentored is all about supporting small business owners throughout the business lifecycle - so from startup, through to growth phase, maturity and exit. Each of these phases is supported by a mix of TV show related video content, a Q&A style experts panel, and more specifically business orientated features like a business listings portal and online deals.
