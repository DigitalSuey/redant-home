        <h3>1. Discovery Workshop </h3>
        <p>Starting with a customised discovery workshop we bring stakeholders together to envisage the audiences, their goals and intelligent ways of supporting their experience. Our workshops are fun, challenging and get to the core of development priorities.  You will leave knowing that your digital project is aligned with stakeholders and organisational goals. Creating the confidence and motivation to move forward</p>

      <div class="col-12 col-lg-4">
        <h3>2. Product Roadmap  </h3>
        <p>Following the Discovery Workshop we use the findings and produce them as a Product Roadmap. The Roadmap communicates the big picture - phases of development and how they align with business goals. It details testing phases and success criteria so you know you are on the right track. The roadmap can be shared with stakeholders, employees and the development team to keep everyone in the tent.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-12 col-lg-4">
        <h3>3. Sprint Plan</h3>
        <p>Finally a Sprint Plan is your actionable guide to getting it done. Using Agile methodology we break down the phases of development into 30 day Sprints detailing development deliverables. Your Sprint Plan will serve as a highly actionable guide that your development team can use to get started, and you can use to engage with critical test criteria along the way.  A sprint plan avoids time and budget blow outs - you can make small corrections during the development phase. A well constructed sprint plan takes away many of the risks involved in a technical build as the complex areas, dependencies and gotchas can be identified before you begin. </p>

        <h2>About Agile Sprint Planning</h2>
        <p>Building a digital product can be daunting. Agile methodology was developed to help tech teams plan their work into short term “sprints” usually around 2 weeks. We tend to use a two week timeframe. This gives flexibility to adapt and make changes along the way. However if you’ve got a fixed budget or fixed timeline - then you’re going to need a bit more certainty.</p>
