#### Project Description

The Outdoor Media Association (OMA) appointed us to build the Australian Out of Home (OOH) industry’s first Automated Proposal Platform (APP).

APP is an automated proposal booking platform for Australia’s largest outdoor advertising networks. Instead of exchanging emails and spreadsheets back and forth, media agencies can use the platform to request proposals from OMA member companies and combine these proposals into a campaign. Agencies can confirm bookings and receive billing files within the software, as well as having access to detailed demographic data from MOVE audience reports.

Initially the platform will enable media agencies to request proposals from OMA member companies and combine these proposals into a campaign. Agencies will then able to confirm bookings and receive billing files within the software, as well as having access to MOVE audience reports.


What is MOVE?

MOVE (Measurement of Outdoor Visibility and Exposure) is the first industry-wide audience measurement system for Outdoor media in Australia. It has been endorsed by the Outdoor Media Association (OMA), the Media Federation of Australia (MFA) and the Australian Association of National Advertisers (AANA).  is a quantitative audience measurement currency that covers all major outdoor advertising environments including roadside, airports, railway/bus stations, buses/trains/trams and shopping centres. MOVE can produce audience measurement results for any combination of formats or tailored packages. As well as providing results numerically, an inbuilt mapping functionality visually displays the reach of a campaign against the chosen demographic and market(s).



“The APP will allow the transaction of briefing, proposal evaluation, booking and billing OOH as seamless as possible. Creating real-time savings for planners and buyers of our channel, by having fast access to a platform that that allows them to visualise information about their campaign and audiences, will help agencies and clients better utilise the benefits of OOH.”
