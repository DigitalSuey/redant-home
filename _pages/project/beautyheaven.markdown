h4. Project Description

Beautyheaven.com.au is one of Australia’s leading independent beauty sites. The site has a thriving membership, who continually add content and reviews to the site.

The beautyheaven site has a very successful loyalty system, where members get points the more they participate on the site – writing reviews of products, comments, and forum postings. They review various beauty products, and there is a crack team of users that road tests various beauty products.

Bits we’re especially proud of:

slideshow tool
quiz tool
product & review pages
Seeded by eye-catching design, great pictures and relevant articles, Beauty Heaven has built a vibrant community of beauty addicts. A savvy membership system raises the status of contributors and gives them a reason to write reviews and give feedback. A smart way to leverage the knowledge of the community.

Editors use content tools to make feature articles stand out
Vibrant community of users in forum and review areas
Interesting tools such as Salon Directory
