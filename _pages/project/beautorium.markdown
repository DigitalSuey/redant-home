#### Project Description

Beautorium is a quarterly event where Beautyheaven members can redeem their loyalty points for beauty products.

Everyone can browse through Beautorium but only members who have reached certain loyalty status can cash in their points.

This site displays products from different brands that are worth points instead of money. Members select the product they like and add it to a shopping cart, once they’re ready they can go through the checkout.
