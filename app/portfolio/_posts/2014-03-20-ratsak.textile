h3. Project Description

Ratsak needed a product site to allow the brand stand out on its own. Previously the brand had been included on the parent company’s website. The site need to inform customers about the problem of rats and mice and provide a product solution to get rid of the rodents for once and for all. The site also addresses customers feelings about rats and mice and let them know they’re not alone.

This is a small website but with great results. Design elements explain the ‘whole of house’ solution and relate to the products packaging for greater in-store recognition.

  <ul>
    <li>Great Visual Design leads to better understanding of the problem and solution</li>
    <li>Honestly talks to the customers feelings about having a rat problem</li>
  </ul>
