          Just like checking your own health, it is useful to get your code
          reviewed and checked out by a different set of eyes. We can give you a
          better idea of the good and the bad, and help you understand technical
          debt.

          We'll perform an expert review of your code for security issues,

                  like repeating lines of code that could be a single function.
                  Or unnecessary complexity. Or bits of code that never actually
                  get called. We’ll look for strengths - what we think is done

                  a series of standardised tests to check performance, security
                  penetration and code analysis. At the same time, our senior
                  developers will analyse the code code for it’s strengths and
