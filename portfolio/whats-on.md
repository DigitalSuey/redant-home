<h2 class="h4">Project Description</h2>

Whatâ€™s On is no ordinary events website. To maximise engagement with the many different communities within the City of Sydney, we built a customised event listing function, allowing organisers to submit their events directly to the website. Visitors can browse events listings via a range of search tools, to find local events, free events and more.

<ul>
<li>Convenient calendar interface for browsing events</li>
<li>Community focus, with submit events function and social media sharing</li>
<li>Meets Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 standards</li>
<li>Search for specific events by location, time, keywords or category</li>
<li>Fully integrated with Google maps</li>
</ul>
