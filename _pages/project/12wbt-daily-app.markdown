#### Project Description

If you haven’t heard of wildly popular fitness program 12WBT by Michelle Bridges you probably been living under a rock. If you truly don’t know how great it is, you can read more about [12WBT here](/project/12wbt/).

So they had an issue where the content on the website, whilst perfect for those users who want to workout or look up meal plans on their desktop or laptop, didn’t work so well for the many users who wanted to participate in the program on their smart phones. The autoplay videos didn’t autoplay, and even if they did the audio didn’t work. Users just weren’t able to easily engage.

There’s where the 12WBT Daily App comes in (free to download on iTunes).

The 12WBT Daily App is a streamlined version of the website, with only the most useful, mobile-optimised content available. Having taken the best bits of the fitness programs, recipes, meal plans and progress stats and adding a dash of push notifications and a smart dashboard, the user now has no excuse not to participate with the 12 week program. It tracks and motivates you to success!

Now it wasn’t easy. There were a couple of problems we needed to solve. A lot of UX went into the design to ensure ease of use for the health-conscious but busy 12WBT member. A 6 month long project, user testing sessions were conducted throughout the duration to make sure we were getting it right. We also wanted it to work both online and offline so users weren’t chewing through their data, so we implemented syncing logic to make sure changes made when offline were updated once back online.

The result is an intuitive app that looks great and works for the user.

And that’s the story of the 12WBT Daily App.
