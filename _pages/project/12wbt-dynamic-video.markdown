#### Project Description

People often talk about scaling technology (getting more traffic, doing more transactions etc). But how do you scale content?

Video content is very popular on 12WBT.com. It makes sense – people want to watch a workout and do it at the same time. Some of the really popular ones are 45 minute videos, which have several trainers doing a workout. Behind the scenes lots of people are involved, this kind of production needs lots of rehearsal, choreography, a dedicated set, and several cameras. Before it is ready, it needs to get edited down and uploaded to a video streaming server.

So they’re popular, but they take a while to make. They don’t scale particularly well.

For the new data driven videos, we took a different approach. A user still gets a 45 minute workout to watch, but we get there via a very different approach.

Instead of shooting everything as one continuous narrative, each exercise is filmed separately. Say the exercise was a push up, we start with someone doing a single pushup – carefully cut so that it can loop seamlessly. We do this for each exercise. Then the fitness content expert uses the CMS to build a workout (a list of exercises) and adds instructions.

When the user gets to the page, we can present a set of HTML5 videos. Each exercise is looped for the correct number of reps. We can even use data from a user’s profile to customise the workout. So if you’re on the strength program you might be asked to do 10 pushups, but a beginner weight loss might be asked to do 5 knee push-ups instead. The end result looks like a normal video, but is actually dynamically assembled.

Taking this approach, the video content becomes scalable. Rather than just a few long videos, we can create literally millions of different workouts.
