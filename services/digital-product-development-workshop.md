        <h3>What is Agile Sprint Planning</h3>
        <p>Agile methodology was developed to help tech teams plan their work into short term “sprints” usually around 2 weeks. We tend to use a two week time frame. This gives flexibility to adapt and make changes along the way. However if you’ve got a fixed budget or fixed timeline - then you’re going to need a bit more certainty.</p>
