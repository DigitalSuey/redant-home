Lots of people start digital projects by listing an App as one of their requirements. Digging deeper, typically what they **actually** want is to connect to an audience of customers - many of which are predominantly mobile. Don't jump to the solution just yet - an App is just one way to to do this. But you need to start by addressing the core requirement - creating something that your audience of customers really want.

Now 12WBT already had this- they have a very successful digital product, with lots of engaged customers. We had already developed the main product so that it was optimised for how their audience was using the product.
