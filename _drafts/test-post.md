Before you start pitching to your investors about how amazing the world will be once you get some AI in your product, spare a thought for the engineering team behind Tay, [the Microsoft AI chatbot](https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist). 

> Unfortunately, the conversations didn't stay playful for long. Pretty soon after Tay launched, people starting tweeting the bot with all sorts of misogynistic, racist, and Donald Trumpist remarks. And Tay — being essentially a robot parrot with an internet connection — started repeating these sentiments back to users

AI technology is amazing, and it's changing and evolving at a rapid pace. It's gone from a hard, obscure technology to a simple service that you can quickly integrate into your product. 

But it can often be quite hard to get a handle on how well it's working. Or if it is actually working at all. In a recent project, we decided to use AI to help us choose a good pet to adopt.
