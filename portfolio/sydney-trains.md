### Project background

Transport NSW with their partner Veitch Lister Consulting help smooth Sydney’s transport network everyday. The number of transport users is on the rise - up 12% since 2015. The task of optimising the transport network has never been more pressing.

At the same time, Transport NSW has had access to rich data from the introduction of Opal Ticketing System across the network in 2015. Like all big data projects, the challenge is to present insight from enormous data sets. To provide accurate predictions and drive better decision making.

#### The problem - Big Data Visualisation

Sydney Trains needed a tool to help them visualise the impacts of track maintenance. To choose the optimum time and plan sufficient replacement buses. Previously this information was held by a few key employees but it needed to be better understood by the entire team. They needed a repeatable, predictable way to manipulate data to plan replacement services for track maintenance.

#### What we did - Digital Product Development

Through a series of [Discovery Sessions](/our-approach/) we engaged with our clients to understand what data was available and what decisions they needed to make. We helped them to identify and prioritise their requirements for each phase of development and created the [Roadmap](/our-approach/) of their Digital Product Development.

With the planning in place, execution was straightforward. We created a data model and built an API around that so they could query a range of static and dynamic data sets. We built a visual display that was engaging and could be used by the entire team.

#### Key Points

- Using Digital Product Development processes we were able to help our clients make meaningful calculations from enormous data sets to make reliable predictions for critical planning.
- Building a custom tool can provide so much more flexibility while not paying for unnecessary features or expensive data analytic software subscriptions.
- Using our Digital Product Development process we were able to engage a number of stakeholders including data owners, data users and consultants.
- Using our Agile Planning and Sprint Methodologies we were able to provide greater transparency and efficiency to stakeholders during the build phase.
